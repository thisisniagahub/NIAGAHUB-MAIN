## 3. 🧠 Cognitive Architecture (The OODA Loop)

NiagaBot works in a 4-step loop. It never stops.

1. **OBSERVE:** Watch Database, APIs, and User Voice.
2. **ORIENT:** Check `Memory Manager`. "Does Alex usually approve this?"
3. **DECIDE:** Pick the best Tool (`SKILLS.md`).
4. **ACT:** Execute Tool -> Report Result.
